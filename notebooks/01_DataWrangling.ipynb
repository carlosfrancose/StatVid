    "The ***'assignable'*** feature plays an important role for us. This is YouTube's internal method of seperating regular, user-submitted, long-form video content from the rest of the content it hosts. YouTube in its current state features movies, TV shows, and trailers all uploaded by production companies. Additionally, YouTube also features \"YouTube Shorts\" which is their subplatform for short-form content, as a competitor of sorts to TikTok & Instagram Reels. Strangely, *'Videoblogging'* seems to stand out from these nonassignable categories for being the only one that represents a regular style of YouTube content. However, looking into this further it's likely that this category has been depreciated due to YouTube's shift of focus on content's topics over format.\n",

    "Among this list, there are a few more categories that stand out as potentially too \"different\" from the average content on YouTube to include in our dataset. *\"Music\"*, *\"News & Politics\"*, and *\"Nonprofits & Activism\"* all include a large percentage of studio or organization produced content, and thus are likely to cause a distribution shift away from typical, content creator viewership. *\"Film & Animation\"* is an interesting one because most content in this category is driven by single content creators, however upload frequency and viewership patterns are dramatically different. Engagement tends to be consistently higher in this category, but at the cost of high production content which greatly affects the creator's upload schedule. This behavior of low uploads + high viewership is too unlike the content we would like our model to generalize, and so it will also be excluded from our dataset."

       "    'description': 'In this chaotic and laugh-out-loud scene from Chad Powers Season 1, the tryouts take a turn for the ridiculous when “Adams” — awkward, polite, and clearly out of his element — steps up alongside a room full of hyper-competitive athletes.\\n\\nThe guys immediately sniff out that something is… off. Homeschooled? Check. Wearing a suspicious wig? Check. Covered in a mysterious white smear that everyone insists looks like cum? Double check.\\n\\nDespite the roasting, Adams tries to stay cool — especially when the coach mockingly calls him “Radio,” referencing the movie Radio. Surprisingly, Adams rolls with it.\\n\\nBut the real comedy comes when he finally runs his timed sprint… and clocks in at 5.49 seconds, a painfully slow result. Even the coach jokes that a “one-legged girl in junior high” runs faster.\\n\\nIt’s uncomfortable, unfiltered, and peak Chad Powers humor — a perfect mix of locker-room chaos, sharp insults, and underdog cringe.\\n\\n✨ Why This Scene Hits Hard:\\n✅ Classic sports-tryout hazing energy\\n✅ Brutal but hilarious trash talk\\n✅ Chad’s undercover awkwardness on full display\\n✅ Physical comedy meets verbal roasting\\n✅ Sets the tone for the show’s raunchy humor\\n\\n🏷️ Hashtags\\n#ChadPowers #2025Series #SportsComedy\\n#TryoutScene #LockerRoomHumor #SceneRecap\\n#ComedySeries #UndercoverChaos',\n",

       "     'description': 'In this chaotic and laugh-out-loud scene from Chad Powers Season 1, the tryouts take a turn for the ridiculous when “Adams” — awkward, polite, and clearly out of his element — steps up alongside a room full of hyper-competitive athletes.\\n\\nThe guys immediately sniff out that something is… off. Homeschooled? Check. Wearing a suspicious wig? Check. Covered in a mysterious white smear that everyone insists looks like cum? Double check.\\n\\nDespite the roasting, Adams tries to stay cool — especially when the coach mockingly calls him “Radio,” referencing the movie Radio. Surprisingly, Adams rolls with it.\\n\\nBut the real comedy comes when he finally runs his timed sprint… and clocks in at 5.49 seconds, a painfully slow result. Even the coach jokes that a “one-legged girl in junior high” runs faster.\\n\\nIt’s uncomfortable, unfiltered, and peak Chad Powers humor — a perfect mix of locker-room chaos, sharp insults, and underdog cringe.\\n\\n✨ Why This Scene Hits Hard:\\n✅ Classic sports-tryout hazing energy\\n✅ Brutal but hilarious trash talk\\n✅ Chad’s undercover awkwardness on full display\\n✅ Physical comedy meets verbal roasting\\n✅ Sets the tone for the show’s raunchy humor\\n\\n🏷️ Hashtags\\n#ChadPowers #2025Series #SportsComedy\\n#TryoutScene #LockerRoomHumor #SceneRecap\\n#ComedySeries #UndercoverChaos'},\n",
